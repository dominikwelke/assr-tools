# assr-tools

This package allows you to easily create and use frequency tagged auditory stimuli in PsychPy. 
It supports a (growing) number of stimuli: 
- different carrier waves, or upload of already existing wav-files you created with some other tools
- deliberate choice of modulation frequency (based on stimulus envelope). 

It further includes a hearing-threshold task to adapt the stimulus loudness for each individual participant.

install using pip:
´pip install assr-tools´

!!make sure to pip install into an environment with working psychopy, otherwise problems might arise!!
