# assr-tools

This package allows you to easily create and use frequency tagged auditory stimuli in PsychPy. It supports a (growing) number of stimuli: different carrier waves, or upload of already existing wav-files yout created with some other tools, and deliberate choice of modulation frequency (based on stimulus envelope). 
It further includes a hearing-threshold task to adapt the stimulus loudness for each individual participant.
